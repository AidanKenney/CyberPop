## What contributions you can make to CyberPop!

First of all, thank you so much for considering contributing to this project! You can contribute in any of those ways:

- Verify if the website is bug-proof as it should be
- Translate the website
- Take a look at the website and its files to check for any typo or any bad grammar, unnecessary code/elements, and so on...
- Attempt to fix open issues
- Make suggestions via the issues tab
- Add lessons

## How should you proceed with adding lessons?

Lessons will be the only content you'll find on CyberPop. They're basically its core, so doing anything with lessons is a huge responsibility, therefore, lessons from contributors are only added once their category is complete.  

Let's say you want to do lessons about Operating Systems. Your pull request will have a chance to be merged only once you're done with all lessons of the "Operating Systems" category. For reference, the only existing category at the moment is "Web Development", while "HTML", "CSS" and "JS" are sub-categories.  

The theme of your lessons has to be technology-related, and shouldn't be specific to a particular software. If you have any doubt, please contact me!

## What you should know before contributing to CyberPop!

- Every webpage should be fast to load, no matter the Internet connection or the device; keep the webpages light resource-wise, with the exceptions of "examples"
- CyberPop's main colors are black and light purple, alongside white text; stick with those colors, avoid the others
- With the exception of the content hosted on [Wikimedia's servers](https://www.wikimedia.org/), no content such as code or images that isn't hosted on CyberPop's servers (or github.io for github pages' case) should be used by CyberPop

## How you can contribute to CyberPop!

You will need to fork CyberPop, then clone the repository you have just created.

Make whatever change you want, then launch CyberPop into some sort of local server.  
You can do that by [using the command prompt into the root folder, and using `py -m http.server` (requires Python 3)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38497334/how-to-run-html-file-on-localhost) then going to localhost:8000 in your web browser.

Once you are satisfied with your changes, you will only need to push them into your repository and make a pull request!
