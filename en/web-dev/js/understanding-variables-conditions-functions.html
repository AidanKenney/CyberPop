			<h1>Understanding the concept of variables, conditions and functions</h1>

			<p>All programming languages are really similar to each other, so this lesson is all about teaching you stuff that is common throughout all programming languages, with Javascript's syntax!<br>For that, let's make a simple webpage that can get affected by multiple JS functions from a same file.</p>

			<a href="./web-dev/js/understanding-variables-conditions-functions-example.html" target="_blank"><img src="./web-dev/images/js-2-1.png" alt="Nothing yet."></a>

			<p>This is pretty straight-forward. There are 6 elements, 5 of them execute a JS function. 2 of those 5 execute the same function, but with a different value.<br>The first element has a bunch of values in its style attribute, and happens to be the only element that'll be affected by our JS functions! Let's take a look at them.</p>

			<a href="./web-dev/js/understanding-variables-conditions-functions-example.js" target="_blank"><img src="./web-dev/images/js-2-2.png" alt="Nothing yet."></a>

			<p>Our first function, <span class="highlight">makeBigger()</span>, associates the value that is given to it to the variable "num".<br>In other words, when you click on the second paragraph, the function is executed with the variable "num" being associated to the integer 2.<br>When you click on the third paragraph, the "num" variable is associated to the integer 50.<br>So whenever "num" is used in the <span class="highlight">makeBigger()</span> function, it is used as an integer that may be either 2 or 50.</p>

			<p>In the second line, the variable size is associated to the font-size of the element which has the "alpha" id, aka the first paragraph.<br>While on the third line, we.. convert to text the sum of "num" and the integer of "size" from which we removed the text 'px', and after all of that, we add to it 'px' to get our final result, and it is that final result that becomes the new size of whatever element has the "alpha" id!<br>In other words, we add to Alpha's font-size the value of "num". Alpha will be the name of our first paragraph.<br>So if Alpha's font-size is 18px, and you click on the third paragraph, the <span class="highlight">makeBigger()</span> function will be executed with a "num" value of 50, which means that the new font-size of Alpha will be exactly 68px, because 50+18=68!</p>

			<p>Still on the third line, notice how many functions integrated to JS we used? We use <span class="highlight">Number()</span> to convert what's between ( and ) to an integer, we use <span class="highlight">.toString()</span> to convert what's before the dot to text, commonly known as string, and we use <span class="highlight">.replace()</span> to replace the first value between the () by the second value, so replacing 'px' by nothing, essentially removing it, from the "size" element.</p>

			<p>As you probably noticed, some of JS' integrated functions work differently from those we have created, affecting what's before a dot rather than the content of parentheses. It's because those functions are associated with the object themselves! Let's take a step back and talk about some basics.</p>

			<p>Everything in JS is an object, and there are different types of objects, such as, but not limited to, string, integer, function, or array.<br>String being text, integer being numbers, function being executable code, array being a collection of objects.<br>Those objects have other objects which are accessible with adding a dot. For example, the <span class="highlight">.replace()</span> function is just an object associated to every string objects!</p>

			<p>Arrays notably have an object called <span class="highlight">.length</span>, which is the number of objects there is in an array besides those integrated with JS.<br>For example, the array at line 18, "colors", has 8 objects, from index 0 to index 7. Therefore, "colors.length" is 7, since 0 is 1!<br>Or, you could think of it differently, "colors.length" is the array's biggest index.</p>

			<p>In the <span class="highlight">changeColor()</span> function, we define the "r", "g" and "b" variables the same way, using two functions from the "Math" object.<br><span class="highlight">.random()</span> and <span class="highlight">.floor()</span> are only two functions among many from the "Math" object, so remembering what each function is not what I am gonna try to make you do. I suggest you try to guess what they do, by thinking, experimenting or looking it up on the web!</p>

			<p>In Javascript, there are many ways of writing a string directly into the code. You can use <span class="highlight">single quotation marks (')</span>, <span class="highlight">double quotation marks (")</span> (both of those work the same way in JS, but may not in other languages) and there are the things used in lines 10 and 11.</p>

			<p><span class="highlight">Backticks (`)</span> are used to show the value of variables in a string, where you put the name of the variable within { and }, which are directly after a $, which are within the backticks.<br>The syntax is basically like that: `My name is ${name_var}!`</p>

			<p>You may have guessed that line 11 works the same way as line 3, it changes a value of Alpha's <span class="highlight">style</span> attribute.<br>Line 21 and 27 work the same way, though 27 is a bit different, more on that later.</p>

			<p>You can find an <span class="highlight">if statement</span> in the <span class="highlight">changeBG()</span> function. It checks whether or not something is true or not.<br>If what's inside the parentheses is true, it executes what's inside { and }. Otherwise, it simply doesn't. But our case is slightly more complex.</p>

			<p>The <span class="highlight">else statement</span> executes what's inside the { and } that are after it if the <span class="highlight">if statement</span> directly before it found out that the condition is false, so in the case of line 15, the <span class="highlight">if statement</span>'s code is executed if Alpha's background-color is red, and in the case it is not, it executes the <span class="highlight">else statement</span>'s code instead.<br>So this code basically changes Alpha's background-color randomly unless it is red, in which case it becomes blue.</p>

			<p>If you want to set up a variable, you use a <span class="highlight">single equal sign (=)</span>, while when you want to set up a condition, more precisely when you want to check whether something is the same as some other thing, you use <span class="highlight">two equal signs (==)</span>. You can use other signs for condition, such as the <span class="highlight">less than sign (<)</span> which checks whether it is true or not that the integer on its left is smaller than the integer on its right. "if (5 < 8)" would be true.</p>

			<p>An array is an object made to contain the objects you want. You can get an object at whatever index by putting next to the array's name a [, an integer representing the index and a ]. So in line 21, it's "i", defined randomly in line 19, more precisely between 0 and the maximum index of the array. colors[2] is the string "green".</p>

			<p>Line 27 is basically an <span class="highlight">if else statement</span>, where the condition is before the "?", the effect if the condition is true is after the "?" and before the ":", while the effect if the condition is false is after the ":". You can really see the difference between the <span class="highlight">single equal sign (=)</span> and the <span class="highlight">two equal signs (==)</span> there.<br>It is called a ternary operation in computer science.</p>

			<p>And finally... oh wait, that's it! You've done it! Congratulations!! You should now have a great understanding of how programming works, as well as JS's syntax!!!</p>
