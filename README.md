# CyberPop!

CyberPop! is a website built to teach the basics of technology to people who don't know anything about it.

Its goal is therefore to make technology more comprehensible to anyone so they cannot get lost learning something technlogy-related on another website or during a course.

**Check [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to contribute to this project!!**

### How do I check out how it looks?

As the website is early in development, it is currently not hosted anywhere on the internet, besides on [GitHub Pages](https://tttaevas.github.io/CyberPop/).
